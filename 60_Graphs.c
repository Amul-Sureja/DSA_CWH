// Graph representation
// 1] Sequential representation (or, Adjacency matrix representation)
// 2] Linked list representation (or, Adjacency list representation)

// There are two primary ways to traverse a graph, which are:
// Breadth-First Search (BFS)
// Depth-First Search (DFS)


// Vertex:	A point or an individual node in a graph.
// Edge:	A connection between two vertices.
// Root:	The vertex from which the traversal starts.
// BFS:	Breadth-First Search is a method for exploring the vertex level by level.
// DFS:	Depth-First Search is a method for exploring the vertex deeply before moving to the next level.
