// => height balanced binary search trees.
// => height diffrence between of left and right sebtrees for every node is less than or equal to 1.
// => balanced factor = height of right subtree - height of left subtree
// |B.F.| <= 1
// => can be -1, 0 or 1 for a node to be balanced in a binary tree.
// => can be -1, 0 or 1 for all nodes of an AVL tree.
